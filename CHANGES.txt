Version 2.2.1
 * Switched from jQuery 1.2.6 to 1.3.2. Also detect if jQuery or $ are in window
   and include our own jQuery if not.

Version 2.2
 * Updated SimileAjax.Graphics._FontRenderingContext.prototype.computeSize
   to take optional second paramenter of classname for computing size on
   screen. See issue 30. -- LarryK rev 1635 and 1637
 * Updated SimileAjax.Graphics._FontRenderingContext.prototype.computeSize
   to use getBoundingClientRect if available. See issue 13
   -- LarryK rev 1635 and 1637
 * Added SimileAjax.Graphics.getWidthHeight(el) RETURNS hash {width:  w, height: h}
   in pixels. File: graphics.js
   -- LarryK rev 1641
 * Updated License to refer to JQuery -- LarryK rev 1641
 * Updated SimileAjax.Graphics.getWidthHeight to better test availability of 
   getBoundingClientRect -- LarryK rev 1657
 * Added new param, maxHeight to SimileAjax.Graphics.createBubbleForContentAndPoint
   Added as last param for backwards compatibility. If used, maxHeight inserts
   a div with a scrollbar in bubble so it won't be taller than maxHeight.
   Bubbles shorter than maxHeight do not get a scrollbar. -- LarryK rev 1666
 * When you run run.bat, we now serve
    http://localhost:8181/ajax - from src/webapp/site/
    http://localhost:8181/ajax/api - from src/webapp/api/
    -- David H rev 1703
