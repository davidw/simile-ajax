Version 2.2.1 -- March 9, 2009
 * Switched from jQuery 1.2.6 to 1.3.2. Also detect if jQuery or $ are in window
   and include our own jQuery if not.
 
Version 2.2.0 -- March 4, 2009

 Notable changes
 * Now including jquery-1.2.6.min.js. Updated License to refer to JQuery
 * Added new param, maxHeight to SimileAjax.Graphics.createBubbleForContentAndPoint
   Added as last param for backwards compatibility. If used, maxHeight inserts
   a div with a scrollbar in bubble so it won't be taller than maxHeight.
   Bubbles shorter than maxHeight do not get a scrollbar.
 * When you run run.bat, we now serve
    http://localhost:8181/ajax - from src/webapp/site/
    http://localhost:8181/ajax/api - from src/webapp/api/
 * Added SimileAjax.version string in platform.js. Issue 60.
 * Fix for issue 13, 30
 * Added SimileAjax.Graphics.getWidthHeight(el) RETURNS hash {width:  w, height: h}
   in pixels.
 * Refactored popup bubble rendering code so that it uses as much CSS
   (rather than Javascript) as possible.
 * See Changes file for more information.
 
 No known issues.
